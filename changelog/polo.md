# Changelog
All notable user-visible changes to **Polo** are documented here.

This project follows **Semantic Versioning** and uses the **Keep a Changelog** format.

**Dependency note:** Polo uses **Core** for parsing and rendering. Polo releases reference the Core version they ship with.

Version scheme note: versions are reconstructed as `0.YY.ZZ` from git history using date-based release groupings starting at the first point where Core, Marco, and Polo co-exist in the repository (2025-10-18).

## [0.24.0] - 2026-06-04

**Uses:** Core 1.1.0

### Added
- Icon toolbar below the titlebar with buttons for Open file, Open in Marco editor, Toggle TOC, Print, and Light/Dark mode toggle. Icons use the Tabler icon set and adapt to the active theme color.
- Table of Contents side panel: auto-populated from document headings, click any entry to scroll the preview to that section. Panel can be toggled from the toolbar or the View menu.
- File → Print (Ctrl+P): opens the native print dialog for the current document preview. On Linux uses WebKit's `PrintOperation`; on Windows uses the embedded WebView2 print API.
- File → Open Recent submenu: lists recently opened files; selecting one reopens the document immediately. The list can be cleared via File → Open Recent → Clear Recent Files.
- Rendering progress overlay shown over the preview while large documents are loading. The overlay displays a framed "Rendering…" indicator with an indeterminate progress bar in the app's blue accent color and stays visible until the preview has fully painted. The overlay follows the active light/dark theme.
- File-based logging, matching Marco's logger. Polo now writes daily log files under `log/YYYYMM/YYMMDD.log` so startup, file open, render, and error events can be inspected after the fact.

### Changed
- Updated to `marco-core` 1.1.0.
- The `marco-core` crate now lives in its own repository (https://github.com/Ranrar/marco-core) and is consumed from crates.io. No user-visible behavior change; pinned via `[workspace.dependencies.marco-core]` in the root `Cargo.toml`.
- CSS theming system was rewritten as a programmatic Rust generator, aligned with Marco's palette constants, so light and dark mode colors are consistent across the two apps.

### Fixed
- Opening large markdown files no longer leaves the preview blank or appears to hang. The viewer now waits for the WebView's load-finished signal before hiding the rendering indicator, so the progress overlay remains visible until the document is actually painted.

## [0.23.2] - 2026-04-28

**Uses:** Core 1.0.2

### Added
- New CI workflow for publishing the shared engine crate `marco-core` to crates.io.
- Polo now consumes the shared print/export CSS from `marco-shared`, keeping its rendering pipeline aligned with Marco's live print and export output.

### Changed
- Windows portable packaging script now resolves the repository root from the script location, so packaging works the same in CI release workflows and manual runs.
- Workspace crate layout was refactored: `core` was renamed to `marco-core`, and shared platform/app logic and assets were extracted into `marco-shared`, which Polo now consumes directly.
- Cross-platform packaging/build scripts and docs were aligned with the refactored crate layout for Linux and Windows artifacts.
- Source file permission metadata was normalized to avoid accidental executable bits on non-executable source/content files across platform checkouts.

### Fixed
- Debian package dependency metadata now supports newer Ubuntu-family runtime naming by accepting `libxml2-16` as an alternative to `libxml2`.
- Linux package build script now correctly detects Cargo's configured target directory when collecting built binaries for the package payload.

### Removed
- Removed the legacy workspace `core` crate path in favor of the `marco-core` + `marco-shared` split.

### Security
- Verified mitigation status for GHSA-82j2-j2ch-gfr8 on Linux and Windows release targets: dependency graph resolves to patched `rustls-webpki` 0.103.13.
- Updated transitive `rand` to 0.8.6 in the workspace lockfile.

## [0.23.1] - 2026-04-14

### Security
- Updated `rand` dependency to address unsound behavior (GHSA-cq8v-f236-94qc).

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-12

**Uses:** Core 0.23.0

### Changed
- Updated to Core 0.23.0.

### Fixed
- Inherited Core parser fixes for nested-bracket links (for example image-in-link syntax) and NBSP spacer paragraph handling.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-08

**Uses:** Core 0.22.0

### Added
- Local link prompt — clicking a local file link in the HTML preview prompts to open that file in Polo; the dialog's cancel action uses a distinct button style to differentiate it visually from the primary open action.

- Updated to Core 0.22.0.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-13

**Uses:** Core 0.21.0

## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-04

**Uses:** Core 0.20.0

### Added
